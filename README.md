# 🚀 Infrastructure

This repository contains the Infrastructure as Code (IaC) configurations for the servers used in my pet projects.

## 🔧 Requirements

To get started, you need to install [Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/aws-get-started/install-cli).

Additionally, you will need a provider token, such as the one from [DigitalOcean](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/account/api/tokens).

## 📖 Usage

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository and Initialize Terraform

```bash
terraform init
```

This command initializes Terraform, setting up the environment from scratch and downloading any required dependencies.

### 2️⃣ Plan the Configuration 📝

To preview the changes Terraform will make, run:

```bash
terraform plan
```

This command will display the execution plan without making any changes to the infrastructure.

### 3️⃣ Apply the Configuration ✅

```bash
terraform apply
```

Terraform will prompt for necessary parameters, such as the provider token, and display the execution plan for review before applying changes.

### 4️⃣ Updating the Infrastructure 🔄

To make changes, update the `main.tf` file and run:

```bash
terraform apply
```

Always commit your changes to ensure the repository accurately reflects the current infrastructure state.

### 5️⃣ Firewall Configuration 🔒

The setup includes a secure firewall configuration to protect your infrastructure. Here are the key details:

- **SSH Access (Port 22)**: The firewall only allows SSH connections from your current public IP address. This enhances security by preventing unauthorized access.

- **Admin Panel (Port 81)**: Similarly, access to the admin panel, typically used for proxy server management, is restricted to your current public IP address, ensuring that only authorized users can perform administrative tasks.

- **Web and Email Services Ports**:
  - **Port 80/443**: These are open to the world, allowing HTTP and HTTPS traffic, essential for web services.
  - **Port 25/465/587**: Commonly used for email traffic, these are also open to accommodate standard email operations.

- **Outbound Rules**: The firewall allows all outgoing traffic, which is necessary for server updates and communication with other services.

By adhering to these configurations, the infrastructure is designed to balance security with functionality, protecting against unauthorized access while allowing necessary operations.

### 6️⃣ Display Infrastructure Details 🌐

After applying your configuration, you can easily find your server’s IP address by displaying the infrastructure details. Use the following command to filter the output and show only the IPv4 address:

```bash
terraform show | grep "ipv4_address"
```

This command extracts the line containing the IPv4 address of your server.

### 7️⃣ Connect to the Server via SSH 🔐

Once you have obtained the server's IP address, you can connect using SSH. If your SSH key is in the default path (`~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`), Terraform automatically sets it up for access:

```bash
ssh root@<server-ip>
```

Replace `<server-ip>` with the actual IP address obtained from the previous command.

### Example Usage

```bash
# Show the current state of the infrastructure and filter for IP addresses
terraform show | grep "ipv4_address"

# Suppose the output is:
# ipv4_address = "123.45.67.89"

# Connect to the server using SSH
ssh root@123.45.67.89
```

### 7️⃣ Destroying the Environment 🗑️

When the server is no longer needed, remove the infrastructure by running:

```bash
terraform destroy
```

This will clean up all resources associated with the environment.

### 🔑 Using Environment Variables (.env) for Terraform Variables

A `.env.dist` file is available in this repository as a reference for setting up your `.env` file. Define your Terraform variables there, such as:

```ini
TF_VAR_do_token=your_digitalocean_token_here
```

To load these variables into your shell session before running Terraform commands, use the following approach:

```bash
set -o allexport
source .env
set +o allexport
```

Now, you can run Terraform commands as usual:

```bash
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

This method ensures your credentials remain outside the codebase while keeping the workflow secure and organized.
